DESCRIPTION OF THE TASKS:
The Interactive Quiz Application is a user-friendly and responsive web-based platform developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It allows users to test their knowledge by answering multiple-choice questions while receiving instant feedback on their performance. This project was built as part of a frontend internship task at Codtech IT Solutions Pvt. Ltd. and aims to demonstrate proficiency in core frontend technologies with dynamic user interaction and real-time response handling.
The application features a minimalistic and intuitive interface that focuses on delivering a smooth user experience. Upon launching the application, users are presented with a series of quiz questions one at a time. Each question includes four options, and the user can select one answer by clicking the respective button. Once an answer is chosen, immediate visual feedback is provided â€” highlighting the correct answer in green and an incorrect one in red (if selected). This promotes active learning by helping users instantly understand their mistakes.
One of the core functionalities of this app is score tracking. After each question, the application updates the score based on whether the user selected the correct option. At the end of the quiz, the user is presented with a summary screen that displays their total score along with an option to restart the quiz. This encourages repeated attempts and enhances engagement.
The application is entirely client-side and does not rely on any backend or database. All quiz data (questions, options, correct answers) is stored in a JavaScript array. This array can be easily modified or expanded to include more questions or even different topics. The question navigation is handled dynamically using event listeners and DOM manipulation, which helps users proceed through the quiz one question at a time without reloading the page.

From a technical perspective, the app showcases effective use of DOM API, event handling, conditional logic, and data-driven rendering. It also maintains a clean structure for scalability and reusability. The layout is styled using modern CSS techniques to ensure it looks appealing and works well on both desktop and mobile devices.
In terms of educational value, the interactive quiz is ideal for use in schools, e-learning platforms, and personal study tools. It can easily be adapted to include timers, question categories, user login, and even backend integration for storing results in a database.
This project demonstrates the importance of interactivity in modern web applications, where users are not just passive readers but active participants. Building this quiz application helped solidify knowledge of core JavaScript programming concepts and front-end architecture while adhering to best practices in code readability, modularity, and responsive design.

Overall, the Interactive Quiz Application is a lightweight, effective, and extensible solution that meets the requirements of a real-world user-facing web application. It highlights the practical application of frontend skills and lays a strong foundation for more complex JavaScript-based projects in the future.
